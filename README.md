## Introducing Me

My name is Alexis Flores, and Iâ€™m a recent graduate from the University of Houston-Clear Lake with a degree in Computer Information Systems. I had the opportunity to intern at Atlink Communications for three months as an IT intern, where I gained valuable experience in customer support using a ticketing system, managing Active Directories, and utilizing remote software to resolve IT issues externally.

During my time at university, I discovered my passion for working with data. Courses like Data Structures, where I learned SQL, and Software Engineering, where I worked on a semester-long group project to design and manage a database, were pivotal in shaping my interest. Now, Iâ€™m driven to break into the analyst field, where I can combine my technical skills and enthusiasm for data to contribute meaningfully to an organization.
